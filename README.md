# **ENMS Project** – IoT-based Energy & Device Monitoring System

## 📌 Overview

The **ENMS Project** is an **IoT-based, real-time monitoring and analytics platform** designed for factories, production facilities, and IoT environments.
It integrates **Node-RED**, **PostgreSQL**, **Grafana**, **Python Flask API**, and **Nginx** into a **zero-touch Dockerized deployment**.

Main features:

* Real-time IoT data ingestion (MQTT, Modbus, APIs).
* PostgreSQL (TimescaleDB) storage for time-series analysis.
* Grafana dashboards for rich visualization.
* Node-RED automation flows.
* Flask API for external integrations.
* Fully containerized for easy deployment.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/raptorblingx/enms-project.git
cd enms-project
```

### 2️⃣ Create the environment file

The project uses a `.env` file to manage essential variables like database credentials and secrets. Create it by copying the template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
*This file contains default credentials. For any non-local or production use, you should update the `MQTT_PASSWORD` and `NODE_RED_CREDENTIAL_SECRET` with your own secure values.*

### 3️⃣ Build & run the stack

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

### 4️⃣ Access services

| Service    | URL                                                                   |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Node-RED   | [http://localhost:1880](http://localhost:1880)                        |
| Grafana    | [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)                        |
| Web Server | [http://localhost/](http://localhost/)                                |
| Flask API  | [http://localhost/api/dpp\_summary](http://localhost/api/dpp_summary) |
| PostgreSQL | `localhost:5432` (user/pass in `.env`)                                |

## ⚙ Environment Variables

All user-configurable variables for the project are managed in a single `.env` file in the root of the repository. This file is not checked into source control and must be created locally.

To get started, simply copy the provided template:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
The `.env.example` file contains all the necessary variables with sensible default values for a local development environment.

**Important:** The default passwords and secrets in the `.env.example` file are for convenience only. You should change `MQTT_PASSWORD` and `NODE_RED_CREDENTIAL_SECRET` to your own secure, randomly generated strings before running the project in any non-local or production setting.
